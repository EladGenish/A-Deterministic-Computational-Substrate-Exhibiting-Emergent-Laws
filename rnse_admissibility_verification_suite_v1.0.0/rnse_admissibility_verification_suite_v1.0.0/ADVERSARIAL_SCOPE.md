# Adversarial Scope (Non-Claims)

This suite is designed to verify **observable admissibility properties** of RNSE
under deterministic replay.

It does **not** claim, prove, or imply:

- That RNSE is a physical theory or replaces physics
- That RNSE is universally optimal on task benchmarks
- That RNSE is intelligent, conscious, or agentic
- That emergent invariants correspond to real-world conservation laws
- That topological invariants imply literal hidden dimensions

The only claims are those measurable by the declared metrics:

- CVR (Constraint Violation Residual)
- RCI (Realignment Cost Integral)

If CVR breaks its bound, the claim breaks.
